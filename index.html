                <h2>I live in one of the richest counties in the country.</h2>
                <p><b>I feel a little startled</b> when I think about living among so much wealth. I wonder, 'Do I earn my income meaningfully & sustainably? Do I spend my earnings meaningfully & sustainably?'. I also feel ignorant. I find mysely trying to comprehend how much money really is around me.</p>

                <h2>What does income & poverty across Connecticut look like?</h2>
                <p>In this project, income levels and poverty levels are highlighted by town. Towns are outlined and color-coded shades of green based on average houshold income values (<i>in the first chart</i>) and color-coded shades of red based on the percent of household that live below poverty (<i>in the second chart</i>). The darker the green, the more income there is in that town. The darker the red, the higher the percentage of households live below the poverty level.*</p>
