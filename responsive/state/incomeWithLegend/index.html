          <h3>The Min</h3>
          <p>The lowest annual average family income is around $36,000, and this is the city of Hartford.</p>

          <h3>The Max</h3>
          <p>The 2 towns that have the highest annual family income are Darien & Weston.These are notes as "$250K+" in the data.</p>
          
          <h3>A Categorical Data Problem</h3>
          <p>The maximum values in the census data are not numerical. The maximum value is categorical, categorizing a family income above 250K$ as simply "250K+". Unlike the rest of the income values, which are numbers and can easily be compared to other numbers, the maximum is unclear. The maximum is interesting to me, and I think the maximum is important in this chart, so having a vague representation of the information looks misleading and unfortunately incomplete.<br>
          For the sake of this project, I used $251,000 as the numerical value in place of the categorically labeled "250K+".</p>
          
          <h3>A Brief Look At The Range</h3>
          <div id="rangeBar"></div>
          <p>The range is at least <b class="incomeRange">$214,000</b>, where the Maximum is '$250K+' and the Minimum is $36,156. Due to the maximum income value recorded at '250K+', the range of town family incomes in CT can not be calculated based on this Census data.</p>
